# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Bryce Chesley

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |        X      |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
Module
The C++ language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. It is based on the C language. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker, which are operating system– and processor-specific. C++ includes the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides support for data structures and threading.

You can read more on sites such as the following:

C++ —Wikipedia (open collaboration site)

C++ Tutorial—W3Schools (tutorial site)

C++ STL Containers—CPlusPlus (reference site)

Unique Requirements & Stretch Challenges
Write one or more programs in C++ that demonstrates some of the following:

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map)

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Modify your program to read and write to a file.

Modify your program to demonstrates inheritance with virtual functions.

Modify your program to use the new and delete operators to dynamically create objects.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? w3schools and chatgpt

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? 
Probably in the order listed, creating a demo file that goes itterativly through each piece of the Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, and Classes.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)? The hangman game looks like the most fun to me currently.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module. Thursdays

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan? Behavioral risk for me is definitely not wanting to work on things before they're due, which can cause unnecessary stress for larger projects that i totally could have worked on earlier. so hopefully i will be able to manage this for this class and spread the load accross many hours and many days.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|  05/3/24 |    3pm   |  5:30  |Got c++ envireonement working and hello world|     2:30   |
|  05/6/24 |    8pm   |   11pm |        Got initial code running            |      3      |
| 05/8/24  |    8pm   |   11pm |        added features and animations       |      3      |
|  05/9/24 |    11am  |   2pm  |                                            |      3      |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/brycches/Applied_programing/tree/master/week%203/Hangman

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |    Y    |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|   Y     |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |    Y    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    Y    |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    Y    |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge. no

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it. no

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       11:30       |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

My treat idea worked great until i ran out of treats.
