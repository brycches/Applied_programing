|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
Write a web app using a framework such as::

Django - Python

Node - Javascript

React - Javascript

The web app must have the following characteristics:
Must have at least two HTML pages populated by content determined by your code. However, if you use React, then you can keep to a single page with multiple interactions.

Your software must be interactive meaning that the content displayed in your web app must be in some part based on user input.

The web app must run on your local computer using the test server provided by your framework. If desired, you can host your web app on a cloud server.

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Integrate a database into your web app.

Add an additional (third) dynamically generated web page to your app.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
chatgpt
django official documentation

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
first create a test project with maybe somthing very simple just to learn the basics, then get more and more into it when making my actual project

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
pokemon calculator maybe

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
mondays and wednesdays

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
burn out. its halfway through the semester with no end in sight, so making sure i stay on top of things well enough

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                    |Hours:Minutes|
