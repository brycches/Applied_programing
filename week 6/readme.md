## Overview

**Project Title**:Pokemon info finder

**Project Description**: using django and javascript together at the same time

**Project Goals**:make a website that uses an API to find data about pokemon, have it use django to handle interpage connections, and other aditional features if i get time.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. make sure you have django and python installed on your computer
2. open the main directory containing manage.py, with all the subfolders inside on your terminal.
3. run the "python manage.py runserver" command
4. go to the link, usually "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

Instructions for using the software:

1. You will find yourself on the landing page. Hit either button to go to one or the other populated page.
2. enter the name of any pokemon, for example try "bulbasaur"
3. on the moves page you will see what moves that pokemon can learn in the games, and which types those moves are effective against and which ones they are not.
4. on the weaknesses page you will see the type defenses of the pokemon you choose.

## Development Environment

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] perhaps add an attacking page, which will sort your moves by which are the most powerful your pokemon can learn against the inputed target pokemon.
* [ ] an actual calculator of stats and moves and attacks, a fully built website for that.
